# Technical Vision

Scalable | Modular | Accessible | Flexible | Decentralized

## [1] Enterprise-level blockchain solution
*Optimized blockchain technology built to scale and adapt to shifting needs.* 
- Identification and focus on new deliverables and commitments. 
- Optimizing the existing processes, including testing, patching and gap identification.
- Building in security mechanisms to address potential DPoS-related vulnerabilities. 
- Lowering the operating cost of nodes and baseline infrastructure to promote robust scaling.

## [2] Expansive roster of maintained libraries and development tools
*Diverse libraries maintained by a decentralized network of developers.*
- Libraries managed by developers who have created them or have extensively modified them.
- Developer commitment to select library or code base.
- Documented development tools supported with recipes and community resources.
- Focus on ease of integration and ease of new development.

## [3] Layered solutions
*First and second layer of plugins that allow for functionality without adding bulk to the blockchain itself.*
- Modular plugins at first layer (blockchain-level) and second layer (applications layer).
- Blockchain layer operations streamlined to focus on governance and native token management.
- Second layer solutions to support custom functions such as smart contracts, fungible and non-fungible tokens, and interactive social applications.
- Standardized microservices to support easy integration of new 2nd layer applications into the Hive ecosystem.

## [4] Decentralized redundancy
*Backup provisions to ensure lossless and continued operation of critical infrastructure.*
- Automatic failover in case of loss or compromise of primary key servers and nodes.
- Geographically distributed servers and nodes to prevent critical infrastructure-based attacks.
- Full utilization of and emphasis on the promotion of Open Source developed and incorporated solutions.
- Teams with overlapping skill-sets for high availability design and support.
