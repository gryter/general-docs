# Technical Vision

Scalable | Modular | Accessible | Flexible | Decentralized

## [1] Enterprise-level blockchain solution
*Optimized blockchain technology built to scale and adapt to shifting needs.* 
- Moving away from pre-existing undelivered commitments designed by pre-fork teams.
- Optimizing the existing processes, including testing, patching and gap identification.
- Building in security mechanisms to address potential DPoS-related vulnerabilities. 
- Lowering the operating cost of nodes and baseline infrastructure to promote robust scaling.

## [2] Expansive roster of maintained libraries and development tools
*Diverse libraries maintained by a group of decentralized developers.*
- Libraries managed by developers who have created them or have extensively modified them.
- Documented development tools supported with recipes and community resources.
- Focus on ease of integration and ease of new development.

## [3] Layered solutions
*First and second layer of plugins that allow for functionality without adding bulk to the blockchain itself.*
- Innovative two-layer approach enables apps developers to create scalable, decentralized apps with their own language and tool choices.
- Modular plugins at first layer (blockchain layer) and second layer (apps layer)
- Blockchain layer operations streamlined to focus on governance and native token management.
- Second layer solutions support custom functions such as smart contracts, fungible and non-fungible tokens, and interactive social applications.
- Standardized microservices to support easy integration of new 2nd layer apps into the Hive ecosystem.

## [4] Decentralized redundancy
*Backup provisions to ensure lossless and continued operation of critical infrastructure.*
- Geographically distributed servers and nodes for service redundancy.
- API libraries support automatic fallover in the case of node failure.
- Full utilization of and emphasis on the promotion of Open Source developed and incorporated solutions.
- Multiple key holders for critical points.
